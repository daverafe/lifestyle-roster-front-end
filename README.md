## Features

In this project you can set up different categories for online shopping called rosters. Within each roster you can add items specific to that roster. You have some info about that item including a link to where you can actually buy it. You can also mark that the item has been bought if you've purchased it already, or if someone else has purchased it for you. Finally there is a page listing all the items that have been bought from all rosters.
